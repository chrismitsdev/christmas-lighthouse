Repo of the The Christmas Lighthouse website.
At the moment, contains only the product catalogue.

A website, built with Next.js, serves as a dynamic digital menu for a caf√©, accessible via QR codes at the tables. It features seamless localization, supporting both English and Greek, ensuring a user-friendly experience for diverse customers. The site includes a secure backoffice system, allowing administrators to log in and efficiently manage menu categories and products with full CRUD functionality.
